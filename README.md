# Advtopics_ML4
This repository provides a comprehensive examination and application of different machine learning models and techniques to tasks in image classification and face recognition. It serves as an analytical base for several key topics within the domain of data science, specifically focusing on the architecture of convolutional neural networks, the utility of transfer learning, and the nuances of weakly and semi-supervised learning. Additionally, it explores the functionality and performance of Siamese networks in the context of face recognition.

Within the repository, you will find detailed explorations of the following areas:

The parameter count and memory footprint of well-known CNN architectures like Alexnet and VGG19, along with an analysis of inception modules as used in Googlenet.
The process and impact of fine-tuning a pre-trained Resnet50 model, including the effects of varying learning rates on model accuracy, and the benefits of using the model as a fixed feature extractor.
A comparison between weakly supervised and semi-supervised pretraining methods based on large-scale image datasets labeled with hashtags, including an assessment of model robustness against label noise and the significance of resampling in hashtag distributions.
The training and evaluation of Siamese networks with different contrastive loss functions, establishing a threshold for face recognition, and assessing performance with face images with varying accessories like glasses.
The repository is structured to guide users through each problem, with dedicated folders containing all necessary code, analyses, and instructions. Contributions for improvement are welcomed, ensuring that the repository remains a dynamic resource for learning and application in advanced data science topics.
